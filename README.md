### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Antonio, a PhD Candidate @ Acoustic Technology Group @ DTU!

I am often involved in...

  :point_right: Spatial Audio,

  :point_right: Virtual Acoustics.

You will mainly find MATLAB code over here, mostly related to publications that you can find on my [webpage](https://orbit.dtu.dk/en/persons/antonio-andr%C3%A9s-figueroa-dur%C3%A1n).
